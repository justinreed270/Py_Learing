Py_Learning

A place where i can practice my python fundamentals and explore new things.

The PycharmProjects folder of my work while following along with the YouTuber, Programming with Mosh. 

The Actionable folder is my work while following along in Nat Dunn's teaching of python3.8. actionable was published in 2020. 

At the time of writing this (early 2022), the latest version of python is 3.10.2. Why am I useing an older version of python? Python 3.8 was the latest version when I purchased the book. I already have that book, so it is no additional cost to me.
