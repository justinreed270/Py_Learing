My first real machine learning project.

We have an online music store.
When users sign up we ask:
    -age
    -gender
Based on their profile, we present them with music albums they are more likely to buy.

Goal:
    Use machine learning to increase sales.

Problem to solve:
    Users want suggestions. We need to make suggestions to the user.

What we will do:
Build a model.
Feed model data based on existing users.
Model will learn the patern in the data so to make predictions.
When a new user signs up, we tell our model and ask it what types of music does the user like.
The model will say:
    -jazz
    -hiphop
    -or whatever.
Based on that we can make suggestions to the user.

Steps:
1. import the data - https://bit.ly/music-csv
2. clean the data
3. split the data into Training/Test Sets
4. Create a Model
5. Train the Model
6. Make Predictions
7. Evaluate and Improve
