****************************************
    installation finished.
Do you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3
by running conda init? [yes|no]
[no] >>>

You have chosen to not have conda modify your shell scripts at all.
To activate conda's base environment in your current shell session:

eval "$(/home/justin/anaconda3/bin/conda shell.YOUR_SHELL_NAME hook)"

To install conda's shell functions for easier access, first activate, then:

conda init

If you'd prefer that conda's base environment not be activated on startup,
   set the auto_activate_base parameter to false:

conda config --set auto_activate_base false

Thank you for installing Anaconda3!
