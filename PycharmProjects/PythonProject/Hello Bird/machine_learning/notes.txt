Machine learning is a subset of AI.
Example:
    create a program to scan an image to tell weather it is a cat or dog.

How it works:
    build a model or ingine and give it lots and lots of data.
    1,000s or 10s of 1,000s of photos of dogs and cats.

Other applications:
    self-driving cars
    Robotics
    Language Processing
    Vision Processing
    Forecasting Stock Market Trends *** crypto???
    games

*****MACHINE LEARNING IN ACTION:*****
Steps:
    1) Import the Data
        .csv files (most of the time)
    2) Clean the Data
        remove duplicates
        remove irrelevant
        remove/edit incomplete data
        if text dased, convert to numerical values
            countries, names, places, etc.
            this really depends on the kind of data we are working with
    3)Split the Data int Training/Test Sets
        example: you can use 80% of the photos for training
            and 20% of the photos for test.
    4) Create a Model
        selecting an algorithm to analyse the data
        Machine Learning algorithms:
            Decision Trees
            Neuro networks/Newworld Networks?
            Side-Kick Learn?
    5) Train the Model
    6)  ask it to Make predictions
    7) Evaluate and improve the predictions

***** LIBRARIES AND TOOLS FOR MACHINE LEARNING****
LIBRARIES (popular in ML projects)
    -Numpy - provides multi dimensional array
    -Pandas - data analysis lib - provides a "Data Frame" (2D structure, similar to an excel spreadsheet)
    -MatPlotlib - 2d plotting library used for creating graphs and plots
    -Scikit-Learn - machine learning algorithm

In machine learning, we use an environment called Jupyter for writting code.
(Technically, you can use any IDE for machine learning. Jupyter is designed
around ML and provides features that other IDEs don't.)
See install.txt to learn how to install Jupyter

***LAUNCH JUPYTER ENVIRONMENT***
1. Open terminal
2. run:
    Jupyter notebook
3. This starts the notebook server on local machine
    automatically opens browser pointing to:
    localhost:8888/tree #Dashboard
4. opens in your local home dir
    navigate to where your machine learning package is.
5. good to go.

****LOAD DATA SET FROM CSV FILE IN JUPYTER****
1. download data set
    in this case from www.kaggle.com - a place to do data science projects
    -create kaggle account
