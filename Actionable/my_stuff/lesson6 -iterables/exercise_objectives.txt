    main():
        Creates an empty dictionary.
        Populate the dictionary it with the class (key) as the user is prompted.
        Grades are entered by the user for the following:
            - English
            - Math
            - Global Studies
            - Art
            - Music
        Program will determine the average grade and print it out.

    Desired Output:
        English grade: x
        Math grade: x
        Global Studies grade: x
        Art grade: x
        Music grade: x
        Your average is: x

    Challenge:
        Ask the user if he/she would like to make any changes.
