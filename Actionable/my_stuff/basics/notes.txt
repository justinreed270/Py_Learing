global_variable.py
    global variables are okay.

fn_parms.py
    Using arguments when you call a function is better.
    Build your functions is such a way that utilizes parameters.
    Functions with parameters are way better than using global vars.
    arguments - (THE VALUE) what is typed in when the function is being called
    parameter - (THE VARIABLE) the code that allows the user to input arguments when the function is being called.
